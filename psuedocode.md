1. Define endpoints for various operations:

   GET /movies // Get list of all movies
   GET /movies/{id} // Get details of a specific movie by ID
   GET /movies/search // Search for movies by title, genre, release year, etc.
   GET /tvshows // Get list of all TV shows
   GET /tvshows/{id} // Get details of a specific TV show by ID
   GET /tvshows/search // Search for TV shows by title, genre, release year, etc.

2. Implement route handlers for each endpoint:

   GET /movies:

   - Retrieve all movies from the database.
   - Return a JSON array of movie objects with basic details.

   GET /movies/{id}:

   - Retrieve details of the movie with the given ID from the database.
   - Return a JSON object containing detailed information about the movie, including cast, crew, ratings, reviews, trailers, and streaming availability.

   GET /movies/search:

   - Parse query parameters (title, genre, release year, etc.) from the request.
   - Query the database for movies matching the search criteria.
   - Return a JSON array of matching movie objects.

   GET /tvshows:

   - Retrieve all TV shows from the database.
   - Return a JSON array of TV show objects with basic details.

   GET /tvshows/{id}:

   - Retrieve details of the TV show with the given ID from the database.
   - Return a JSON object containing detailed information about the TV show, including cast, crew, ratings, reviews, trailers, and streaming availability.

   GET /tvshows/search:

   - Parse query parameters (title, genre, release year, etc.) from the request.
   - Query the database for TV shows matching the search criteria.
   - Return a JSON array of matching TV show objects.

3. Define database models for movies and TV shows:

   Movie:

   - Title
   - Genre
   - Release Year
   - Cast (array of actor objects)
   - Crew (array of crew member objects)
   - Ratings (array of rating objects)
   - Reviews (array of review objects)
   - Trailers (array of trailer objects)
   - Streaming Availability

   TV Show:

   - Title
   - Genre
   - Release Year
   - Cast (array of actor objects)
   - Crew (array of crew member objects)
   - Ratings (array of rating objects)
   - Reviews (array of review objects)
   - Trailers (array of trailer objects)
   - Streaming Availability

4. Implement data retrieval and manipulation functions to interact with the database:

   - Retrieve all movies and TV shows
   - Retrieve movie/TV show details by ID
   - Search for movies/TV shows based on various criteria
   - Add new movies/TV shows to the database
   - Update existing movie/TV show details
   - Delete movies/TV shows from the database

5. Integrate third-party APIs for fetching additional data (e.g., trailers, streaming availability).

6. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms if required.

7. Implement error handling and logging to handle exceptions and debug the application.

8. Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or Insomnia to ensure they work as expected.

9. Document the API endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and authentication requirements.
